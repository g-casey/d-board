# Dboard

A decentralized forum/imageboard/social media proof of concept. 

All posts and user data are distributed in a peer to peer fashion without the use of one centralized server.  This is done through a library called gun.js. 

All user logins are secure and encrypted. 
 
User interface is currently lacking and a few bugs exist
